# DISCLAIMER

This game, the "Dojo of Death" has been recreated and ported to HaxeFlixel for educational and nostalgia purposes. 

It is important to note that the original version of this game, developed in Flash, is no longer available to play due to the End-of-Life (EOL) of Flash.

I want to make it clear that **I do not own the rights to this game, as the copyrights rightfully belong to their respective owners.** 

The educational nature of this project lies in the fact that it is open-sourced, allowing everyone to access the source code and study it as **a valuable HaxeFlixel resource demo**. Additionally, this recreation aims to evoke nostalgia for those who enjoyed the original game.
